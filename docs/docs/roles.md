## How to use Roles

Roles are Ansible roles that are applied to VMs in Ludus after they are deployed and configured. It's easy to add a role to a Ludus VM, simply define the `roles` key in the config:

```yaml title="range-config.yml"
ludus:
  - vm_name: "{{ range_id }}-docker-host"
    hostname: "{{ range_id }}-docker"
    template: debian-12-x64-server-template
    vlan: 10
    ip_last_octet: 11
    ram_gb: 8
    cpus: 4
    linux: true
    //highlight-next-line
    roles:                  # This key is an array of user-defined roles that will be installed on this VM. Roles must exist on the Ludus server and can be installed with `ludus ansible role add`
    //highlight-next-line
      - geerlingguy.docker  # Arbitrary role name, as it appears in `ludus ansible roles list`
    role_vars:              # This key contains `key: value` pairs of variables that are passed to ALL user-defined roles.
      docker_edition: ce    # Arbitrary variables for user-defined roles. Do *not* use hypens to prefix these variables, the role_vars key *must* be a dictionary!
      docker_users:         # You can use lists or dicts here
        - localuser
```

You can define any variables that will be passed to the role with `role_vars` as seen above. Note that all variable in `role_vars` will be passed to all roles.
